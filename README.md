# Growth-Rush
Growth Rush is a project that I made over the course of 5 months during my free time after work. 
The knoweldge comes mostly from my own research and also two online lessons that I took on Udemy.


<em>The intended design:<em>
The final goal would be a single-player moba, where the player starts in a base on a mirrored map and the other base is controlled by AI.
The player must help his troops push against the AI's troop, either through direct combat or by purchasing upgrades.


<em>The troops.<em>
